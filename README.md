# mp4-to-pdf
Make videos into pdf - seperate frames and saves them as images and pdf in the output folder. Mainly for youtube videos that have sheet music. 

# instructions
First, you should place the "main.mjs" file in a directory. You must create two other directories in this directory - one with the name "input" and one "output". They should be empty. Install all the libraries imported in the "main.mjs" file. now you can use the mp4-to-pdf. 
Place the video in the "input" folder as an mp4, and then run main.mjs. The output folder would have your pictures, and a pdf that has all of them by order. Delete them before your next use (and the input video as well, of course).
