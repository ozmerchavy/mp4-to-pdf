# mp4-to-pdf
Make videos into pdf - seperate frames and saves them as images and pdf in the output folder. Mainly for youtube videos that have sheet music. 

# instructions
Place the video in the "input" folder as an mp4. Make sure you have installed all the imported libraries of the "main" file, and then run it. The output folder would have your pictures, and a pdf that has all of them by order.
